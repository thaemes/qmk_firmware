This layout comes with five layers.  
- DF: A Base layer defaulting to macOS style modifiers;
- WL: An alternative default layer with windows-style modifiers
- MF & WF: Function layers, specific for macOS and Windows to make shorcuts like switching between desktops consistent.
- CL: Configuration layer (reached by pressing space from a function layer). For reset, clear eeprom, enable/disable LEDs, configure layer indicator color, brightness and saturation (see special keycodes below):
